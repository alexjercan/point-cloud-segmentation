# Point Cloud Segmentation

## TODO

- [x] exploratory data analysis
    - [x] try to import challenge src
    - [x] distribution of the classes for train set, test not available
    - [x] try to plot some of the points, maybe using knn to sample objects
    - [ ] how was the lidar sensor used and which positions are used for train and test set

- [ ] implementations
    - [ ] PyTorch Dataset
    - [x] PointNet++
    - [ ] Point Cloud Transformer
    - [ ] Compare the two implementations
